# Traditional Modern Data Warehouse
Big data, Databricks and now also Synapse Analytics. Microsoft really focuses on how to put together BI and DWH solutions that can handle huge volumes of data. But what about the "ordinary" solutions in the SME market? How do we put together a sensible and affordable Azure solution for them? Where we can reuse the competencies we have already built from making the same solutions on SQL Server.

## The architecture
A very simple ETL framework based on Data Factory, Data Lake, SQL DB and Power BI
